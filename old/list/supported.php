	If you know of a mod that's not on this list, please let us know. There are three ways to inform us of new mods. The preferred way is to use <a href="/list/submit/">the submission form</a>, which makes the process of adding the mod much faster. If you have an account on the Minecraft Forums, you can also leave a post in the suggestion thread <a href="http://bit.ly/13fsFlm" class="ns" title="The original Minecraft Forums post for the mod list">here</a>, or drop by the <span style="color: #0481ff">#mcf_modlist</span> IRC channel on <span style="color: purple">EsperNet</span>. Please check to see if the mod is already on the list or <a href="/list/submit/list.php">already submitted for review</a> before suggesting.

	If there's an icon in the "Info" column, hover over it to read the description for that mod.
