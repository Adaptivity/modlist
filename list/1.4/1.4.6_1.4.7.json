Bordering this lake you will find sand for water, or gravel for lava. Connecting each sphere is a wooden bridge with fence rail. Beside each sphere is a smaller sphere, which is where you will find diamond and lapis lazuli. These ores only occur here, the others are equally spread throughout the spheres. The cave generator used here is a modified Nether cave generator, where like on the surface, will generate lava below a certain level.

    "desc":"A highly configurable addon for IndustrialCraft with several modes depending on how much time and dedication you're willing to spend on it. On top of allowing you to configure previously existing recipes to your liking, this addon also adds higher levels of technology to work towards. It's frequently used on servers so that people don't get all possible technology in a single day.",

Too Many Items was great, but the one thing it lacked was an easy way to search and sort your items.

But the roots of life planted their seeds in this place too, growing a huge vibrant world, with nothing in it, animal-wise.Explorers of the ancient ancestors of both Steve and the Villagers, entered this wonderful world, by using the most advanced spells they had. They did it before with the Nether and the End, so why not this new realm?Not only the humans entered this new world, which was called the Erebus, ''the Underground''. Various bugs traveled with them, hidden in their skin and inventory.The explorers build beautiful buildings, from small villages to huge pyramids. But the bugs... the overdose of oxygen, caused by the plants producing so much air that couldn't go anywhere else, caused them to mutate into much larger forms.Unfortunatly, this meant the end for these explorers. The ones that weren't eaten by the arthropods traveled back to the Overworld, leaving behind the temples they created to access the Erebus.Now, there is a world with dangerous arthropods, long abandonded by any form of vertebrate life, ready to be explored.",
