Each are optional, but installing all of them will deliver the full experience.Mystic Ores adds 4 nether ores and 7 overworld ores as well as 1 blastproof glass block into the game, some of which can be used to create some quite impressive tools!Mystic Ruins adds 2 new structures, some overworld ruins which can contain treasure chests, as well as massive underground dungeons that also double as mazes, as you can quite easily get lost in them!Mystic Stones adds 7 new stones to the game, as well as planks, bricks, and cobbled versions of each. It also adds reinforced bricks, a compatibility pack for Mystic Ores, which allows you to compress your gems/ingots from Mystic Ores into blocks, which double as beacon bases (currently bugged, fixing right now) and are blastproof.

Too Many Items was great, but the one thing it lacked was an easy way to search and sort your items. When you had a mod like Red Power coming along with 10000 items both TMI and Recipe Book were racking up the pages.
