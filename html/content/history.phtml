		Originally initiated by catqueen5, this was a huge text list handmade into several thread posts.<br />
		Yes, that's as painful as it sounds.<br />
		<br />
		Some time after, ZeroLevels, a <abbr title="Minecraft Forum">MCF</abbr> moderator, took over as catqueen5 no longer had the time to mantain it.<br />
		The thread then evolved into...

		The site was created and hosted on several free hosting sites, but the amount of bandwidth always went over what the servers would allow for a free plan.<br />
		Luckily, citricsquid decided to host the project on his domain and servers.<br />
		At this point all of the site pages were being manually made by hand. ZeroLevels alone took the massive project.

	<div class="panel-body">
		GrygrFlzr met ZeroLevels in the #minecraftforge IRC channel, and soon realized how inefficient the project was.<br />
		The site undertook a complete overhaul behind the scenes (though it may not look like it) and human errors were then minimized.

	<div class="panel-body">
		Still, the site felt outdated. At this point ZeroLevels has been busy with life, so GrygrFlzr was doing a lot of the work by himself.<br />
		Some of the workload had been reduced during the Back-end Changes, but the efficiency of the submission form increased the rate of the mods that were submitted.<br />
		One of GrygrFlzr's friends told him about a CSS Framework and this site was made within the span of 2 months.

		ZeroLevels is finally able to find free time and actively add mod submissions on to the list.<br />
		He has retired from being an MCF Moderator, and the modlist thread ownership has been passed on to him.<br />
		Some more table designs are tested and applied to the site.
